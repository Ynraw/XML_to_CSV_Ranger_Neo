# XML_to_CSV_Ranger_Neo
Converts xml files from a Promax Ranger Neo Signal coverage tool.

Although users of Promax Ranger Neo are offered to convert their files at their website https://www.promax.es/tools/kml-generator/settings/ I decided to make my own CSV converter.
One reason is that I want to extract some of the data parameters that the website does not. Second I could easily convert xml files offline and finally I can convert multiple
files at once.

I am using lxml to parse the data and pandas to convert it to csv.

For those who are seeking to convert xml to kml or to exccel you can go to the promax website, because they offer these options however if your game
for a journey then let us all make these options.
